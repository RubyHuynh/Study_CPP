<h1> 2019 switched to a new prj.</h1>

<h3><u>Targets:</u></h3>
<ol>
    <li> Learn C++ from C, think in C++.
    <li> Design Patterns?
</ol>

<h3><u>Done:</u></h3>
<ol>
    <li>basic operator overloading</li>
    <li>reading "The C++ programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup </br>
        <ol>
            <li> Feeling </br>
                <p> I must say that I hate the way the author writes about C, like:<i> "C is a subset of C++", "C++ is a better C" </i>. really???
                This standard book also has too much "pride" attitudes about C++ "invention", cannot compare to the simplicity-straight forwarded book written by Brian W.Kernighan & Dennis M.Ritchie.
                Anyway, now I have to deal with this book to "think in C++", it had better be as good as it is introduced. </p>
            </li>
            <li> Intro </br>
                <ol>
                    <li>classes oriented.</li>
                    <li>type strict at compile time.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Basics </br>
                <ol>
                    <li>"auto" type.</li>
                    <li>const (validate at runtime), constexpr (at compile time).</li>
                    <li>variable can be defined on the fly. (but Stack space is reserved at the beginning, doesn't it??).</li>
                    <li>the null pointer: "nullptr" is used in C++, be careful in comparing C-functions which return "NULL" or 0.</li>
                    <li>"reference": no need to use "*" to access the value the reference refer to. Can only be referred at initialize.</li>
                </ol>

    <li>Common Bug, Note</br>
        <ol>
